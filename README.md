## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JS library
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - React framework
- [React-Router-Dom](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) - React framework

### Continued development

Since this is the third projects that I created using Reactjs and Tailwindcss, maybe for the next project I would like to try out Typescript to build a project. Or React Typescript would be fun too.

### Useful resources

- [How to get user width dynamicly](https://www.jsdiaries.com/how-to-get-the-width-of-the-window-in-react-js/) - This helped me for to get the windows width. The documentation about the code is very clear.
